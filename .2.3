    - ERROR | spec: The specification defined in `echo` could not be loaded.

[!] No podspec exists at path `echo`.

[!] echo did not pass validation, due to 1 error.
[!] The validator for Swift projects uses Swift 3.0 by default, if you are using a different version of swift you can use a `.swift-version` file to set the version for your Pod. For example to use Swift 2.3, run: 
    `echo "2.3" > .swift-version`.
You can use the `--no-clean` option to inspect any issue.
